    <h2>Feta-Stuffed Hamburger</h2>
    <p>
        This is a great hamburger for the grill. Feta cheese gives it a rich and creamy taste.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef
        </li>
        <li>Â½ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
        </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried parsley
        </li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste
        </li>
        <li>1 cup crumbled feta cheese </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Preparation Steps</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
            <p>Step 1</p>
            Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat.<br>
            Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes.<br>
            Stir in ground turkey; cook until no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Drain excess grease.<br>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
            <p>Step 2</p>
            Knead together the ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, parsley, salt, and pepper in a bowl.<br>
            Form the mixture into 8 equal-sized balls; flatten to make thin patties.<br>
            Place about 1/4 cup of feta cheese onto each of four of the patties.<br>
            Top each of the patties with cheese with one of the patties without; press the edges together to seal the
            cheese into the center.<br>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
            <p>Step 3</p>
            Cook on the preheated grill until the burgers are cooked to your desired degree of doneness, 7 to 8 minutes
            per side for well done.<br>
            An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).<br> </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
